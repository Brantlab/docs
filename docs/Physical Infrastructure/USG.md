# USG Pro

## Why do I run this
It was donated into my lab by a real good friend of mine. This is mostly spousal approval factor so that way I don't take the net down anytime I wanted to do host maintenance. I used to run a virualized PFsense firewall and this firewall has many of its capabilties but not quite all of them. I am still pretty happy with the results thus far. 

## Model
USG-Pro-4

## This is all you get
There really isn't much more info I can give you about this device without feeling like I am giving someone more info to infiltrate my network.
